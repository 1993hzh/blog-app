## Developed with swift in xcode7
## IOS App for blog, currently adapt for iPad air2
#### Introduce: 
This is my first iOS app, link below[1] is what I learned before working on this app, I think it's really useful for green hand like me.
#### What's more: 
Without doubt, the first version of blog app is not good at all(design, code, UI and so on), anyway, it's a good start and I will develop second version later.
